# flashTAB
Creates automatic flashcard-style, multi-directional MCQs from infodense tables

Instructions for use:
 - Excel files must be in same folder as .exe
 - Do not change sheet names (ie. data should only be entered into the first sheet, 'Sheet1')
 - Tables should be such that the first row is a header row

Potential for future development:
 - Implementation of learning / staged repetition 
 - Score-keeping
 - Porting to iOS
 
However, this was admittedly just made for personal use and meets my present needs well (lazy keyboard-driven flash/question cards), so I may or may not be making much active progress either here or towards much of a GUI in the near future.
